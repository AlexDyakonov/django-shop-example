# django-shop-example

Welcome to the repository for the **django-shop-example** Django project! This project is a full-fledged e-commerce website that includes various features such as product management, customer management, shopping carts, cryptocurrency payments, email notifications, and English localization.

## Project Features

1. **Product, Customer, and Cart Models:** I have created data models for products, customers, and shopping carts to manage information about products, customers, and cart contents.

2. **Cryptocurrency Payments with Coinbase Commerce:** I integrated Coinbase Commerce to process cryptocurrency payments, allowing users to make purchases using various cryptocurrencies.

3. **Email Notifications:** I configured email notifications using SMTP to inform users about orders, order status changes, and other important events.

4. **English Localization:** To enhance accessibility for English-speaking users, I added English localization.
